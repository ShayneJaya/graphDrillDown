# graphDrillDown
This set of code enhances an Oracle APEX application by dynamically injecting a button into a tooltip (modal) when it appears and allowing users to trigger an AJAX request to redirect based on extracted data. A MutationObserver continuously monitors the DOM for changes, detecting when the tooltip appears, and calls addButtonToTooltip(), which appends the button to the tooltip's footer. When clicked, this button triggers handleButtonClick(), which extracts the EMPLOYEE_ID from the tooltip, sends it via apex.server.process() to the PL/SQL backend, which constructs a dynamic URL using APEX_UTIL.PREPARE_URL and returns it as JSON for redirection. If the tooltip structure changes, if an expected element is missing, or if the AJAX request fails, error handling via apex.message.showErrors() provides debugging feedback. This implementation ensures that the button only appears when needed, prevents duplicate event handling, and seamlessly integrates with APEX's AJAX and session management features.
